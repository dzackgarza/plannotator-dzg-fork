  type: task
title: review mode (diff types, async feedback, git-add)
description: 'Semantic deps: None.  Setup: tmp git repo, commit baseline, modify a
  file to create a known diff (use `make-repo.sh`).'
successCriteria:
- E2E coverage proves every supported review diff type against a known git fixture and validates the returned patch and UI file tree.
- Review feedback delivery is verified as asynchronous and non-blocking for the invoking command surface.
- UI-driven stage and unstage behavior through `/api/git-add` and review cancellation both behave as documented.

## 5.1 Diff type matrix
For each of `uncommitted`, `staged`, `unstaged`, `last-commit`, `branch`, `worktree:<branch>`:
1. Set up the repo for that diff type
2. Run `plannotator review --diff-type <type>` (background)
3. Assert `GET /api/diff` returns the expected `rawPatch`
4. Assert file tree in UI lists expected files
5. Drive UI to add code annotation + global comment → click Send Feedback
6. Assert agent-side CLI receives the feedback string

## 5.2 Async feedback delivery
Verify review is non-blocking: tool returns immediately (~few seconds); daemon enters `active/mode:review`; UI feedback triggers async delivery.

## 5.3 `git-add` endpoint
Drive UI's "stage" button → run `git status` → assert file is staged. Click again with `{ undo: true }` → assert unstaged.

## 5.4 Cancel from review
Cancel in UI → assert daemon state → `idle`; async callback delivers cancel string.
