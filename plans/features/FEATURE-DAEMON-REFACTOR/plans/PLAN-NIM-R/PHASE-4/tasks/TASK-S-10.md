title: S-10 Run manual and automated verification for the daemon model
description: 'Execute the manual and automated checks that prove the daemon model
  works end to end.  Verification rules:'
successCriteria:
- Manual smoke tests cover idle status, daemon start and stop, approve, deny with feedback, collision handling, buffered verdict recovery, daemon crash recovery, forced clear, Claude hook flow, and OpenCode flow.
- Automated verification runs the real E2E proof harness plus the paired TDD suites for [[TASK-S-1]] through [[TASK-S-9]].
- Verification exercises real fixtures, real commands, real daemon processes, and real user-visible workflows rather than mocks or internal-only checks.
- The full verification pass catches lifecycle, collision, buffering, recovery, GUI-visible behavior, and integration regressions before release acceptance.

## Description

- This task consumes the umbrella proof policy from [[TASK-S-9.5]] and the paired proof
  tasks for each implementation slice rather than inventing late test coverage after
  implementation.
- No mocks, no faked data, no substitute backends, and no tests that only prove internal
  consistency.
- Validation must run real fixtures, real commands, real servers, and real user-visible
  workflows.
- Implementation writers do not modify the frozen proof suites after handoff; production
  code must be corrected until the proofs pass.

Manual smoke tests, in order:
1. `plannotator daemon status` returns `not running`.
2. `plannotator daemon start` prints port and URL.
3. `plannotator daemon status` returns `running, idle`.
4. `plannotator submit example-plan.md` from a second terminal fires a notification,
   opens the browser, blocks the CLI, and exits 0 after browser approval.
5. Repeat the submit flow but deny with feedback; CLI exits 1 and prints feedback.
6. Submit while a previous document is still in review; the second submit returns
   structured 409 current-doc info and exits 2.
7. Kill the agent CLI mid-review, approve in the browser, then run `plannotator wait`
   from a fresh terminal; it prints the buffered verdict, exits 0, and returns the
   daemon to idle.
8. Kill the daemon mid-review with `kill -9`, restart it with
   `plannotator daemon start`, verify recovery as `verdict_ready` with `cancelled`, then
   consume via `plannotator wait`.
9. Run `plannotator clear --force` from any non-idle state and verify it resets to idle.
10. Run the Claude Code end-to-end flow and confirm the hook shells out to the CLI and
    verdicts flow back correctly.
11. Run the OpenCode end-to-end flow and confirm `submit_plan` is serviced through the
    daemon model.

Automated verification:
- Run the real end-to-end proof harness from [[TASK-S-9.5]].
- Run the paired TDD suites for [[TASK-S-1]] through [[TASK-S-9]].
- Run state-machine unit tests from the daemon state module.
- Run daemon-lifecycle integration coverage that spawns the daemon, exercises the
  endpoints, and verifies state transitions.

Pass criteria:
- Lifecycle, collision, buffering, recovery, GUI-visible behavior, and integration
  behavior all match the sprint plan.
- Regressions in daemon wait semantics or state transitions are caught by real proofs
  and integration checks rather than by users.

- Validation must run real fixtures, real commands, real servers, and real user-visible
