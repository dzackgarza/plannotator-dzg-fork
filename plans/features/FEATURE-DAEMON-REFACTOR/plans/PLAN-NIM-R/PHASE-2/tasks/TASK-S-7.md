title: S-7 Add notifications for state transitions
description: Add local OS notifications when a document enters review.
successCriteria:
- Cross-platform local notification dispatch exists on the supported runtime paths used by the daemon.
- Notifications fire when a document enters review and do not fire on verdict-ready transitions.
- Notification suppression through the accepted environment control is respected if configured.
- The targeted proof for [[TASK-TDD-S-7]] passes and the surviving build path remains green.

## Subtasks
- Create `packages/server/notify.ts`.
- Implement cross-platform dispatch for macOS, Linux, and Windows with runtime detection.
- Fire notifications on `idle -> in_review` with the document title and daemon URL.
- Do not notify on `in_review -> verdict_ready`.
- Optionally respect `PLANNOTATOR_NOTIFY=0`.

Scope note:
- This remains local-only. The goal is a practical user signal, not a broader collaboration mechanism.

Delegated to child session `0dad2ebd-951b-49f6-8280-ca4f8ee39a22` in worktree `/home/dzack/gitclones/plannotator-dzg-fork_worktrees/fleeting-moose` after checkpoint commit `2f948e8`.

Acceptance target:
- `bun test tests/nim-19.notification-proof.test.ts`

Implementation must satisfy the accepted [[TASK-TDD-S-7]] proof without weakening tests.

### Comment (2026-05-01T05:06:08.738Z)

The initial delegate `0dad2ebd-951b-49f6-8280-ca4f8ee39a22` was explicitly abandoned and replaced after showing no worktree changes and no session activity beyond creation. Reassigning [[TASK-S-7]] to a fresh child session.

### Comment (2026-05-01T05:06:30.343Z)

Replacement delegation assigned to child session `592727ce-a5af-40c4-b9f5-1e24c7890c5b` in worktree `/home/dzack/gitclones/plannotator-dzg-fork_worktrees/neat-vapor`.

Acceptance target remains:
- `bun test tests/nim-19.notification-proof.test.ts`

The first delegate was explicitly abandoned for inactivity.

### Comment (2026-05-01T05:08:08.433Z)

The second delegate `592727ce-a5af-40c4-b9f5-1e24c7890c5b` was explicitly abandoned and replaced after showing no worktree diff or result output despite repeated polling. Escalating [[TASK-S-7]] to a direct worker delegate.

### Comment (2026-05-01T05:14:07.341Z)

[[TASK-S-7]] is now reassigned to direct worker agent `019de1f5-2bea-74f0-a632-2c42cd8a8a16` (`Bohr`) after two inactive meta-session delegates. Acceptance target is unchanged: `bun test tests/nim-19.notification-proof.test.ts`.

### Comment (2026-05-01T05:21:24.131Z)

Accepted in `main` as `0e361ba` `feat: add local review-entry notifications`.

Verification in `main`:
- `bun test tests/nim-19.notification-proof.test.ts`
- result: `4 pass, 0 fail`
- `bun run build:hook`
- result: success

Note: the root `build:hook` script change was retained because the previous script failed on current `main` by trying to copy `../review/dist/index.html` before it existed.
