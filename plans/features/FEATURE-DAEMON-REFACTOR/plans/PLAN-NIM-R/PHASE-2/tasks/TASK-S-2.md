title: S-2 Define daemon state machine module
description: Create `packages/server/state.ts` as the authoritative daemon state machine.
successCriteria:
- '`packages/server/state.ts` defines the authoritative daemon state types and transition logic consumed by downstream daemon surfaces.'
- State persistence through load/save behavior is explicit and tested rather than implied by ad hoc callers.
- Illegal transitions are rejected through one consistent state-machine contract that later HTTP/CLI layers can map into user-visible behavior.
- The targeted proof for [[TASK-TDD-S-2]] passes, including transition legality, persistence, and recovery semantics.

## Subtasks
- Define `DocMode`, `FeedbackPayload`, and `DaemonState` types.
- Implement atomic `loadState()` and `saveState()` persistence to `~/.plannotator/state.json`.
- Implement a pure `transition(current, event) -> next` function.
- Reject illegal transitions by throwing so the HTTP layer can map them to 409 responses.
- Add unit tests covering every legal and illegal transition.

Why it matters:
- This is the core correctness surface for the refactor. Everything else depends on state transitions being explicit and testable.

### Comment (2026-04-30T16:07:10.262Z)

Delegated [[TASK-S-2]] implementation to child session `1d234b76-a894-4452-a84e-10e4619448a5` (`gpt-5.4`) in worktree `/home/dzack/gitclones/plannotator-dzg-fork_worktrees/noble-fern`.

Handoff included:
- full [[TASK-S-2]] tracker specification
- [[TASK-TDD-S-2]] proof context and accepted commits `57847a2` and `7abb111`
- explicit instruction not to rewrite or weaken the accepted proof
- required verification via `bun test tests/nim-14.state-machine-proof.test.ts`

### Comment (2026-04-30T16:18:09.646Z)

Accepted delegated [[TASK-S-2]] implementation and integrated it into `main` as commit `e3a98bc` (`feat: add daemon state machine`).

Final acceptance phase:
- `bun test tests/nim-14.state-machine-proof.test.ts`
- result: 20 pass, 0 fail

Outcome:
- `packages/server/state.ts` now exists as the authoritative daemon state machine
- transition legality, persistence, and recovery semantics satisfy the [[TASK-TDD-S-2]] proof surface
- ready for the next dependent proof task ([[TASK-TDD-S-3]])
