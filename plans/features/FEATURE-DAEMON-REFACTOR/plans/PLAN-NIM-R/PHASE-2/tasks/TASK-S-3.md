title: S-3 Refactor per-mode servers into a multiplexed router
description: Unify the existing plan, review, and annotate server routers behind one
  daemon fetch handler.
successCriteria:
- A multiplexed daemon router serves plan, review, and annotate flows behind one daemon fetch surface.
- Mode-sensitive endpoints read daemon state rather than per-invocation closure state and reject mismatches with the accepted 409 behavior.
- Browser actions update daemon state through event-bus-driven verdict handling instead of per-invocation shutdown promises.
- The targeted proof for [[TASK-TDD-S-3]] passes without weakening the accepted router test surface.

## Subtasks
- Extract a `createDaemonRouter(state, eventBus)` that owns the combined Bun fetch handling.
- Move the overlapping endpoints into the daemon router and have them read from daemon state instead of closure-captured per-invocation locals.
- Return 409 for mode-specific endpoints when the active state does not match the requested mode.
- Serve the matching UI bundle at `/` based on the active mode.
- Replace closure-promise resolution with event-bus-driven approve/deny/cancel handling.
- Remove `/api/shutdown`; browser actions should update state only.

Dependency notes:
- This should be built directly on top of the state module so endpoint behavior stays consistent with the daemon lifecycle and wait semantics.

### Comment (2026-04-30T16:29:06.563Z)

Delegated [[TASK-S-3]] implementation to child session `4aec33b5-707b-4fa9-a031-1ae5f0bfa30f` (`gpt-5.4`) in worktree `/home/dzack/gitclones/plannotator-dzg-fork_worktrees/cool-lake`.

Handoff included:
- full [[TASK-S-3]] tracker specification
- [[TASK-TDD-S-3]] proof context and accepted commit `39b000a`
- explicit instruction not to rewrite or weaken the accepted proof
- required verification via `bun test tests/nim-15.multiplexed-router-proof.test.ts`

### Comment (2026-04-30T17:12:02.834Z)

Accepted delegated [[TASK-S-3]] implementation and integrated it into `main` as commit `2662e03` (`feat: add multiplexed daemon router`).

Final acceptance phase:
- `bun test tests/nim-15.multiplexed-router-proof.test.ts`
- result: 6 pass, 0 fail

Outcome:
- multiplexed daemon router implemented
- mode-sensitive 409 behavior, bundle serving, and no-shutdown behavior satisfy the [[TASK-TDD-S-3]] proof surface
- ready for next dependent proof task ([[TASK-TDD-S-4]])
