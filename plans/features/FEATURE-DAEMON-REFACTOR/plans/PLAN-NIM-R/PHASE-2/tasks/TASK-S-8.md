title: S-8 Refactor agent integrations into thin CLI clients
description: Reduce the Claude Code and OpenCode integrations to thin wrappers around
  the CLI.
successCriteria:
- Claude Code and OpenCode integrations shell out to the CLI instead of directly hosting their own server implementation path.
- Agent-specific policy remains in wrapper code while daemon-general behavior stays out of the integration layer.
- Hook-envelope and tool-return behavior match the accepted wrapper contract for submit, review, and annotate flows.
- The targeted proof for [[TASK-TDD-S-8]] passes without weakening the accepted wrapper test surface.

## Subtasks
- Refactor the Claude Code hook shim so it reads stdin payloads, shells out to `plannotator submit`, and converts exit codes into hook decision JSON.
- Refactor OpenCode tools so `submit_plan`, review, and annotate shell out to the CLI instead of hosting their own server paths.
- Keep agent-specific policy in the integration layer, including the OpenCode compliance token validation.
- Delete `apps/pi-extension/`. Verified: `apps/pi-extension/` is absent from the active source tree. Any reintroduction is a regression caught by [[TASK-E15]] §99.11.

Architectural rule:
- The daemon must stay general-purpose. Agent policy belongs in the wrappers, not in daemon state transitions or transport logic.
## Comments

### Comment (2026-05-01T16:39:19.398Z)

Delegated to child session `a4bc8409-eb8e-4345-9799-9f86474c8e41` in worktree `/home/dzack/gitclones/plannotator-dzg-fork_worktrees/grand-lark` after checkpoint commit `e7c6c93`.

Acceptance target:
- `bun test tests/nim-20.agent-wrapper-proof.test.ts`

Production code must satisfy the accepted [[TASK-TDD-S-8]] proof without weakening it.
