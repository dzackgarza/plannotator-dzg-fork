title: S-6 Define the CLI surface around the daemon
description: 'Refactor the CLI entrypoint so the daemon becomes the public interface
  and the stable user-facing API.  Command matrix:'
successCriteria:
- The public CLI surface exposes daemon lifecycle, status, submit, review, annotate, wait, clear, and open commands around the daemon model.
- 'Collision output, reconnect behavior, exit codes, and `--json` behavior match the accepted CLI contract rather than legacy hook-only behavior.'
- A shared daemon bootstrap path starts or reaches the daemon consistently before CLI commands proceed.
- The targeted proof for [[TASK-TDD-S-6]] passes without weakening command-surface or collision UX assertions.

## Description
- `plannotator daemon start`: start detached, idempotent, print port and URL.
- `plannotator daemon start --foreground`: internal foreground entrypoint for the spawned daemon process.
- `plannotator daemon stop`: stop daemon, idempotent.
- `plannotator daemon status`: print running or not running, URL, and current state summary. Exit 0 when running, 1 when not.
- `plannotator status`: alias for daemon status plus one-line active document summary.
- `plannotator submit <file> [--mode plan|annotate] [--no-browser] [--commit-message <msg>]`: auto-start daemon, POST submit, block on wait, return verdict.
- `plannotator review [--diff-type uncommitted|staged|unstaged|last-commit|branch]`: submit captured diff as review mode.
- `plannotator annotate <file>`: submit annotation target as annotate mode.
- `plannotator wait`: consume buffered verdict or block for an active review.
- `plannotator clear [--force]`: preview what would be cleared unless forced, then reset daemon state.
- `plannotator open`: open the daemon URL in a browser.

Required behaviors:
- Implement a shared `withDaemon(fn)` helper that starts the daemon when needed and waits for liveness.
- Render structured 409 collisions with doc title, mode, submit time, current status, resume URL, and literal `plannotator clear --force` guidance.
- Implement CLI-side SSE handling with one retry; after a second drop, exit with a clear lost-connection error.
- Document exit codes in `--help`: 0 approved, 1 denied, 2 illegal-state rejection, 3 daemon failure, 130 cancelled.
- Remove legacy `plannotator sessions` subcommands.

Why this matters:
- This is the primary human interface to the daemon, and the 409 error path is one of the most important UX surfaces in the project.

### Comment (2026-05-01T00:25:27.504Z)

Delegated [[TASK-S-6]] after accepting [[TASK-TDD-S-6]] proof commit `f7f39ea` and checkpointing `main` at `846f233`. Verification target for this implementation is `bun test tests/nim-18.cli-contract-proof.test.ts`.

### Comment (2026-05-01T04:53:19.607Z)

Accepted child implementation commit `cfaa7a0` and integrated it into `main`. Verification in `main` is running against `bun test tests/nim-18.cli-contract-proof.test.ts`.

Refactor the CLI entrypoint so the daemon becomes the public interface and the stable user-facing API.

Command matrix:
- `plannotator daemon start`: start detached, idempotent, print port and URL.
- `plannotator daemon start --foreground`: internal foreground entrypoint for the spawned daemon process.
- `plannotator daemon stop`: stop daemon, idempotent.
- `plannotator daemon status`: print running or not running, URL, and current state summary. Exit 0 when running, 1 when not.
- `plannotator status`: alias for daemon status plus one-line active document summary.
- `plannotator submit <file> [--mode plan|annotate] [--no-browser] [--commit-message <msg>]`: auto-start daemon, POST submit, block on wait, return verdict.
- `plannotator review [--diff-type uncommitted|staged|unstaged|last-commit|branch]`: submit captured diff as review mode.
- `plannotator annotate <file>`: submit annotation target as annotate mode.
- `plannotator wait`: consume buffered verdict or block for an active review.
- `plannotator clear [--force]`: preview what would be cleared unless forced, then reset daemon state.
