title: S-4 Implement daemon process lifecycle
description: Create `packages/server/daemon.ts` to own daemon startup, detached launch,
  stop, status, and recovery.
successCriteria:
- Daemon foreground and detached lifecycle commands can start, stop, inspect, and recover a live daemon process with lockfile ownership.
- Startup recovery preserves or downgrades persisted review state according to the accepted lifecycle contract rather than silently discarding it.
- Liveness checks and stale-lockfile handling are centralized in the daemon lifecycle surface rather than spread across callers.
- 'The targeted proof for [[TASK-TDD-S-4]] passes on the accepted `packages/server/daemon.ts` surface.'

## Subtasks
- Implement `runDaemon()` for foreground daemon execution with fixed-port bind, signal cleanup, and lockfile write.
- Implement `startDaemonDetached()` with detached spawn and log redirection.
- Implement `stopDaemon()` with stale-lockfile handling.
- Implement `daemonStatus()` with liveness checks based on `process.kill(pid, 0)`.
- Recover persisted state on startup, preserving `verdict_ready` and downgrading stale `in_review` to a cancelled verdict.

Success criteria:
- The daemon can be started, stopped, introspected, and recovered cleanly without depending on ephemeral per-invocation server shutdown paths.

### Comment (2026-04-30T23:43:19.841Z)

Delegated [[TASK-S-4]] to child session `600049f0-2fb8-42a7-bc6b-776a19ec0043` in worktree `/home/dzack/gitclones/plannotator-dzg-fork_worktrees/rushing-star` after accepting [[TASK-TDD-S-4]] proof commit `86da359`. Verification target for this implementation is `bun test tests/nim-16.daemon-lifecycle-proof.test.ts`.

### Comment (2026-04-30T23:50:05.374Z)

Accepted child implementation commit `5422218` and integrated it into `main` as `7abdda4` `feat: implement daemon lifecycle ownership`. Verification in child worktree passed the full [[TASK-TDD-S-4]] proof suite. Main-branch verification is running against `bun test tests/nim-16.daemon-lifecycle-proof.test.ts`.
