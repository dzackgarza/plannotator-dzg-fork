title: TDD for S-4 daemon lifecycle and recovery
description: Write the proof cases for daemon start, stop, status, detached launch,
  liveness checks, and crash recovery before implementation completion.
successCriteria:
- Proof cases cover real process spawning, lockfiles, signals, stale-lockfile handling, and restart recovery behavior.
- 'The proof targets the accepted daemon lifecycle surface in `packages/server/daemon.ts` rather than an invented helper surface.'
- The proof exposes the missing lifecycle implementation before [[TASK-S-4]] and remains the acceptance gate afterward.

## Description
Requirements:
- Use real process spawning, real lockfiles, real signals, and real restart flows.
- Prove stale-lockfile handling and recovered verdict behavior with actual daemon commands.
- Avoid fake process stubs as the primary proof surface.

Process rule:
- This proof task must be authored separately from implementation, and [[TASK-S-4]] writers may not weaken or rewrite the tests after handoff.

Delegated [[TASK-TDD-S-4]] proof authoring to child session `52e9aec9-551f-4c2c-a58a-7ac552de5685` (`gpt-5.4`) in worktree `/home/dzack/gitclones/plannotator-dzg-fork_worktrees/silver-vapor`.

Handoff included:
- full [[TASK-TDD-S-4]] tracker specification
- [[TASK-S-9.5]] TDD constraints
- [[TASK-S-4]] target implementation context
- explicit instruction not to implement daemon lifecycle production code
- required verification via direct `bun test ...` on the new proof file

Replacing prior empty delegate `52e9aec9-551f-4c2c-a58a-7ac552de5685` after verifying its worktree stayed at checkpoint `cb978ff` with no edits and no reported result. Reassigning [[TASK-TDD-S-4]] to a fresh proof-authoring child session with the full tracker spec and explicit non-goals.

### Comment (2026-04-30T23:38:35.001Z)

Rejected child commit `0a5bc8d` during review. Local verification in child worktree still failed on the wrong invented surface `packages/server/daemon-lifecycle.ts` / `runDaemonCommand(options)` instead of the actual [[TASK-S-4]] target `packages/server/daemon.ts`. Sent a stricter revision request covering both target-surface mismatch and missing recovered-verdict proof semantics.

### Comment (2026-04-30T23:40:03.549Z)

Explicitly replacing child session `8fc924bd-b822-4124-8579-a6624618bc69` after repeated noncompliant proof revisions. Verified twice in the child worktree that the draft still targets the invented surface `packages/server/daemon-lifecycle.ts` instead of the actual [[TASK-S-4]] target `packages/server/daemon.ts`. Main agent is taking over [[TASK-TDD-S-4]] locally.

### Comment (2026-04-30T23:42:46.224Z)

Accepted local takeover for [[TASK-TDD-S-4]] after replacing the noncompliant delegate. Verified in `main` with `bun test tests/nim-16.daemon-lifecycle-proof.test.ts`; the proof now fails cleanly on the correct missing [[TASK-S-4]] surface `packages/server/daemon.ts` and defines the expected lifecycle/recovery semantics for later implementation.
