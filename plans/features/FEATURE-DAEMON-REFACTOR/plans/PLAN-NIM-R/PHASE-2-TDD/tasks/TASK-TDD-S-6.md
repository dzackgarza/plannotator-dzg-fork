title: TDD for S-6 CLI contract and collision UX
description: Write the proof cases for the public CLI contract before implementation
  completion.
successCriteria:
- Proof cases cover the public CLI command matrix, stdout/stderr behavior, exit codes, reconnect behavior, and 409 collision guidance.
- The proof validates the human-facing CLI contract through actual command execution rather than parser-only checks.
- The proof exposes the missing daemon-first CLI surface before [[TASK-S-6]] and remains the acceptance gate afterward.

## Description
Requirements:
- Use real daemon commands, real stdout and stderr behavior, real exit codes, and real 409 collision output.
- Prove the command matrix, reconnect behavior, and recovery command guidance with actual command execution.
- Validate the human-facing contract, not just argument parsing.

Process rule:
- This proof task must be authored separately from implementation, and [[TASK-S-6]] writers may not weaken or rewrite the tests after handoff.

### Comment (2026-05-01T00:10:47.939Z)

Delegating [[TASK-TDD-S-6]] proof authoring after accepting [[TASK-S-5]] commit `a85fa40` and checkpointing `main` at `7c8b877`. Verification target for the proof task is `bun test tests/nim-18.cli-contract-proof.test.ts`.

### Comment (2026-05-01T00:24:29.797Z)

Accepted child proof commit `1be9652` and integrated it into `main`. Verifying in `main` with `bun test tests/nim-18.cli-contract-proof.test.ts`; expected red phase is the missing public daemon CLI surface, currently falling back to hook-mode stdin parsing.
