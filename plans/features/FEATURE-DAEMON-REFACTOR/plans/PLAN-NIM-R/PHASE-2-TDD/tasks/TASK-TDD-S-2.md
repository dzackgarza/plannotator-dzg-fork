title: TDD for S-2 state transition correctness
description: Write the proof cases for daemon state transition correctness before
  implementation completion.
successCriteria:
- Proof cases cover legal and illegal daemon state transitions using real state snapshots and daemon semantics.
- Persistence, save/load behavior, and recovery semantics that matter to CLI and daemon flows are part of the proof surface.
- The proof exposes the missing state-machine implementation cleanly before [[TASK-S-2]] and remains the acceptance gate afterward.

## Description
Requirements:
- Cover legal and illegal transitions with real state snapshots and real daemon semantics.
- Prove persisted state behavior, atomic save/load behavior, and recovery semantics that matter to later CLI and daemon flows.
- No mock-only proof surface; the tests must reflect real state transitions the daemon will consume.

Process rule:
- This proof task must be authored separately from implementation, and [[TASK-S-2]] writers may not weaken or rewrite the tests after handoff.

### Comment (2026-04-30T15:10:29.734Z)

Delegated [[TASK-TDD-S-2]] proof authoring to child session `6501aa6a-8f72-4414-82ff-e2451a4a4720` (`gpt-5.4`) in worktree `/home/dzack/gitclones/plannotator-dzg-fork_worktrees/hollow-quartz`.

Handoff included:
- full [[TASK-TDD-S-2]] tracker specification
- [[TASK-S-9.5]] TDD constraints
- [[TASK-S-2]] target implementation context
- explicit instruction not to implement `packages/server/state.ts`
- required verification via direct `bun test ...` on the new proof file

### Comment (2026-04-30T15:27:06.548Z)

Accepted delegated [[TASK-TDD-S-2]] proof authoring and integrated it into `main` as commits `57847a2` (`test: author [[TASK-TDD-S-2]] daemon state proof`) and `7abb111` (`test: tighten [[TASK-TDD-S-2]] proof gating`).

Final acceptance phase:
- `bun test tests/nim-14.state-machine-proof.test.ts`
- result: 1 intentional red failure, 0 passes
- failure is the expected missing implementation signal: `packages/server/state.ts` does not yet exist

Outcome:
- pre-[[TASK-S-2]] red state is now high-signal and controlled
- detailed transition/persistence/recovery proof cases activate once `packages/server/state.ts` exists
- ready for implementation task [[TASK-S-2]]
